# Task: Choose and set up a team password manager
**Description:**

A password manager can help organize and manage secrets such as passwords and
notes containing sensitive information in a safe way, and share them safely
between members of a team. Having a team password manager in place will mean
that we never have to resort to emails, instant messages, sticky notes, or
knowledge bases for sharing secrets.

When possible it is good practice to use separate, individually named accounts
for team member of the team so that the actions can be attributed to the person
who performed them. However, sometimes we will still end up with secrets that
we need to share with various members of the team.

Here are five key considerations when choosing a team password manager:

* Are any password managers already in use within the organization or by many
  members of the team?
* Do we want to have commercial support if something goes wrong?
* Is there a need to have an easy-to-use graphical interface?
* Do we need Active Directory / SAML / SSO integration?
* Is it permissible to use a cloud based service?

You may also find it useful to consider:

* Do we need two factor authentication in the password manager itself?
* Does it support auditing?
* Are a lot of people on the team already using a tool?
* Is using open source allowed or desired?
* Do we want breach notifications?
* Can people continue to use it as a tool for their own personal needs after theyâ€™ve left the project?

* Can add secrets to the password manager
