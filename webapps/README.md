# Web Applications

## Why?

Web applications are incredibly popular, but browser vendors have
historically made a lot of poor security decisions. The situation is
getting better, but the web remains a largely hostile platform to
build applications for.

This pushes a lot of responsibility onto application developers. We
must turn on options that should really be on by default, add
application level mitigations for vulnerabilities that are inherent to
the platform, and keep up with the increasing number of controls being
made available to fix historical mistakes.
